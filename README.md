# Setting up any new jupyter notebook project

1. Go to https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter
2. Click on "Use this template"
3. Select a name for the repo, description, set to private/public etc
4. Go to code - > open in Codespaces
5. Enter package requirements in requirements.txt
6. Make a virtual environment when prompted
7. Type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal
8. Follow the intructions in the terminal to open the notebook; e.g.
`    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree?token=2a357a6dcea48f109ce164c5dbca53034938c1f763219cd2`
        I was not able to get this to work so instead use instruction 9
9. ALternatively, in github, click on code/[name of running codespace]/open in jupyter labs
which will take you to `https://scaling-orbit-4pgjq9jp5937pxg.github.dev/?editor=jupyter` where
scaling-orbit-4pgjq9jp5937pxg.github.dev is the name of the codespace.
10. Add code to the notebook
